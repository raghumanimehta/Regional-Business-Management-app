# Regional Business Management Application

## A management system for simple operation across regions

- The application will provide a way to manage various **outlets/offices/stores for businesses across regions**.
  Some examples of functionality are **managing operation costs and revenue, transferring resources as and when needed or adding new outlets**.
- **Anyone can use the software**, ranging from small business owners operating from their homes to big regional corporations.
- I've always been interested in how businesses run and manage their resources judiciously and how they maximize their profits.
  I want to develop this application to understand the inner workings better.
  Moreover, such a project is a practical implementation of software design in the corporate world.

## User Stories
- As a user, I'd want to be able to add new outlets and remove existing outlets.
- As a user, I'd want to be able to calculate revenue and expenses.
- As a user, I'd want to be able to view all the stores/outlets/offices and manage them, for example, hiring employees 
for a particular store. 
- As a user, I'd want to be able to transfer resources or stock of various products from one store/outlet to another.
- As a user, I'd want to be able to manually save the data regarding my business.
